          Communion Service is a sacred gathering where believers come together to remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ through the breaking of bread and the sharing of the cup. It is a time of reflection, thanksgiving, and renewal, as we honor the body that was broken and the blood that was shed for the remission of our sins (Luke 22:19-20). In this holy moment, we reaffirm our covenant with Christ and with one another, embracing unity, love, and the grace freely given to us. Join us as we partake in this divine fellowship, drawing closer to God and strengthening our walk with Him.

It is a moment to honor God for who He is and for all He has done, as we sing, pray, and receive His Word with gladness (Psalm 100:2, John 4:24). In worship, burdens are lifted, lives are transformed, and faith is renewed. Come and be part of an atmosphere filled with joy, reverence, and the overwhelming love of God as we worship Him in spirit and in truth.
